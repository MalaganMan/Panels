"EX5R Switches.bpanelz" is propably at stage of final version, but I might in future add some editing functions there.
The EX5/7 parameter sysex bug made some difficulties in making the panel, but it is actually in case of this hardware pretty useless sysex-implementation after all and new implementation has even removed parameter request totally from it's documentation.

"YAMAHA A4000 SAMPLER MANIPULATOR.bpanelz" is a work in process still and has probably several bugs.
I intend to add *.syx file loading and saving cababilities to the panel in the future.
Update: Of which some are now present for testing.
Bank and whole sample data via number *.sysex handling is still missing.
Removed the bugging FX controls.

"V-Verb Pro FULL.bpanelz" is also a work in process as it only receives few first engine A model modulators fully from the sysex-dump.
