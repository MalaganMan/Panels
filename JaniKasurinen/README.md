"EX5R Switches.bpanelz" is propably at stage of final version, but I might in future add some editing functions there.
The EX5/7 parameter sysex bug made some difficulties in making the panel, but it is actually in case of this hardware pretty useless sysex-implementation after all and new implementation has even removed parameter request totally from it's documentation.

"YAMAHA A4000 SAMPLER MANIPULATOR.bpanelz" is now at current final state and wont likely to be edited soon again.

"V-Verb Pro FULL.bpanelz" is also a work in process as it only receives few first engine A model modulators fully from the sysex-dump.
 - On 2024 20th April removed file handling triggering bug.
 
"Korg Z1 Editor.bpanelz" is still greatly work in process stage and does NOT have all the modulators, but file loading saving and storing functions fully.
 
"Korg Prophecy Editor.bpanelz" has surely still many bugs and only few modulators are now fetch from the program bulk dump, but likewise to Z1 panel file handling and sysex-dumping work fully already.
