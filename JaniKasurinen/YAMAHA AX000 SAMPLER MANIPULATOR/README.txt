"YAMAHA A4000 SAMPLER MANIPULATOR.bpanelz & YAMAHA A5000 SAMPLER MANIPULATOR.bpanelz"
- Update 2024 22th April 04:25 GMT: FIXED file handling bugs and removed PC hanging os.time function.
- NOTE!: After experimenting with midi dumps you must send all data in this order back to A4000: 
"wavedata" - "sample bulk" - "sample bank dump" - "Program dump".
- I gave up trying to calculate the right checksum so only unmodified midi dumps will succeed hence the checksum is incorrect otherwise and will fail the dumps.
- UPDATE 23th April 2024: Added more features of which most usefull is the objectlist request.
- UPDATE 23th April 2024 #2: Uploaded YAMAHA A5000 panel version with correct "family device code" ASCII "5" = 35h = 53 incomparison A4000 ASCII "4" = 34h = 52.
- UPDATE 26th April 2024: Bug fixes on MIDI ON/OFF. Object list bug fixing. Object list is now at least quite functional.
- UPDATE 27th April 2024: Major bug fixes and separated object types into own list from dump.
- UPDATE 29th April 2024: Removed Program list. Major bug fixes.
	- File Load Cancelin actually triggered earlier buffers to be send and written to the text boxes.
- Hopefully last update for a looog time: Object lists now injects names from list strings to name boxes for selecting samples and samplebanks easier.
- Last piece of advice: Edit the "Program Select" -modulator to send program change CC (number 32 seems to work) and allow program change in YAMAHA AX000 and you will always have the matching "Program Number" and "Program Name". - Update: That is done.
- WARNING! SAMPLE DUMPS TO AX000 CAN EMPTY WHOLE RAM MEMORY FROM DEVICE EASILY. SO DOODLE EASY.
	- UPDATE: Limited "wavedata" to 1 packet to avoid corruption.
